    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project involved developing a program that computes the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
        between two input strings using dynamic programming. The program takes two sequences as input
        and calculates the length of the LCS, optionally displaying the subsequence itself. The solution
        demonstrates how to efficiently solve a classical algorithmic problem by breaking it down into
        smaller subproblems and storing intermediate results in a table.
